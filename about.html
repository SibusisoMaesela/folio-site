    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there, I'm Sibusiso Maesela, an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating elegant and user-friendly websites. Even though majority of my work is web programing, I can also move into other projects. I classify myself as a full stack developer with a couple of languages under my belt. I'm on a mission to leverage technology to make the web a better place. 

        I'm a creative problem-solver who thrives on challenges and enjoys collaborating with fellow developers. In my free time, I'm an avid reader, a nature enthusiast, and a lifelong learner. I'm always eager to take on new projects and explore the ever-evolving world of web development.
        
        If you have a project in mind, want to discuss collaboration, or just want to chat about the latest trends in web technology, don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm looking forward to connecting with you!"
        
        I am still on the process of learning react and bootstrap. Plus I'm more than willing to adapt to any language you feel is the right feel for the company. My unique abilitly to grasp concepts almost immediately will make me a great asset to you.</p>

        <h2>Counter</h2>
        <p>The portfolio website has showcased my HTML and CSS skills but you haven't seen my Javascript skills. I made a counter. How it works is that, if you press increment, it will increase the number by one each time. and if you press decremnet, it will decrease the number by 1 each time. I hope you have fun counting.</p>
        <p>I do realise that this is too simple but I just wanted to showcase my basic knowledge. If you want an advanced demonstration, you're more than welcome to request me to create something.</p>
        <div id="counter-box">
            <div id="counter-number">0</div>
            <button id="increment">Increment</button>
            <button id="decrement">Decrement</button>
